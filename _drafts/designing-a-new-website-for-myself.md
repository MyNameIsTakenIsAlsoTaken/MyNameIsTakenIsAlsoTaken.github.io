My website currently uses Jekyll static site generator with Type-on-Strap theme. I add and edit posts using the awesome Forestry content management system. The whole site is hosted on GitHub Pages. When I first started out, this was a great combination, because I was seeking simplicity. But it has been more than a year and I have grown ambitious.

So I am redesigning my website. After looking all around, I have come to the conclusion that no theme suits anyone, which is why I have decided to design my own theme. I haven't had any problems with Jekyll, so I will keep using it. For a static site, hosting shouldn't be a problems so I might go with GitHub Pages or something like that, but to add a layer of dynamicity, I am planning to use the free and open Travis CI with Cron Jobs. I used Disqus for comments but I never really liked it. I am looking to implement either some javascript based system with Firebase backend or a normal Git Commit and an hourly Cron Job to publish the comments.

I have the following goals in terms of site structure and implementation:

* Standard HTML and CSS, following the best practices.
* Responsive design.
* Attention to Typesetting
* Designed for Speed
*
