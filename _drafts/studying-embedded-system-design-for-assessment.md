Studying for exams is so boring, you know? You study and study, with no intention or time to put any of it in practice, just so that you can wake up super early one morning, rush to the exam hall, make sure you haven't forgotten your admit card, and regurgitate it all with teachers patrolling like vultures, as if we're prisoners.
