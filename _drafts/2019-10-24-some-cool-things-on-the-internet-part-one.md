I randomly came across Marijn Haverbeke's [website](https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/ "Marijn's Website"). He has done a lot of extremely important and interesting stuff (codemirror, Eloquent Javascript, Tern), but his submission to [js1k](https://js1k.com "js1k code golfing") was particularly impressive. As always, when I come across really interesting on the internet, I hit `Ctrl+S` to save it for offline browsing. This strategy used to work nicely up till a few years ago because, thanks to the long power-cuts and on-and-off internet connectivity, you had no choice but to 'surf' your local hard drive most of the time. But these days I rarely, if ever, care to wander into the abandoned folders and files of the offline-land. So, in an effort to not forget, I am compiling lists of cool internet stuff right here on this blog.

I need to set a few ground rules so as not to go overboard with this. It is important that I:

1. add things to this list as I find them on the internet and write a short description.
2. use minimal effort per entry.
3. refrain from listing extremely specialized information.

### One-Bit Music by Tristan Perich

Pictured above is an album with about 40 minutes of music. But it's not a conventional album. It has all the electronics and power required to play the music right in the Jewel case. Having done [some similar projects](https://nirav.com.np/2018/12/20/on-sound-and-audio-generation-using-atmega-microcontrollers.html) in the past, I loved what the artist [Tristan Perich](http://www.tristanperich.com/) has done here. 

I found his website a long time ago, when researching to accomplish something similar, and it struck a chord with my sense of aesthetics. As I was writing this post, I remembered the project and decided that it must be included here.

### Build an electroluminescent display by Applied Science

This video is one of my favourites on youtube, because Ben demonstrates the engineering process in such an incredibly interesting manner. If you liked this, also checkout his other video titled, "Electroluminescent paint and multi-channel control circuit".

Some other videos that I love to rewatch are
