Da Vinci is quoted saying, "Art is never finished, only abandoned". I don't see why it should be any different for code. With that said, I'd like to declare my latest project: an implementation of Huffman's algorithm, finisâ€” abandoned. Abandoned. I meant to say abandoned. Missed my chance.

So anyway, I've been working on it for about a week. I started a day before my Data Communication assessment inspired by a chapter on the Information Theory. So there I was, at 11 in the night, having read for the first time in my life about Huffman algorithm and **I was thrilled!** I decided then, in the spur of the moment, to pull an all-nighter and write code for the Huffman algorithm. Then I boiled some water, made myself a cup of strong coffee. And then I fell asleep.

After an anticlimactic start.
