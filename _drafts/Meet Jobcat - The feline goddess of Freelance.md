Pride. It makes people do stupid things. It drove Colonel Aureliano Buend√≠a into several years of war. It caused both Mr. Darcy and Miss Elizabeth to suffer throughout the book. And now, it has made me want to bang my head on the wall more times than I'd ever have thought was possible. In fact, if you plot the number of times I have wanted to bang my head on the wall as a function of time, you will find that it traces a roughly exponential curve, culminating on Feb 9, five days before the sad valentine's.

What the heck am I talking about? Well, first I bit a lot **lot** more than I could chew, but then procrastinated away for months so that now, when the deadline is knocking, I'm having to chew and chew and chew and chew. Pride won't let me spit, and deadline is knocking on the door like my own decrepit self is banging his head on the wall.
