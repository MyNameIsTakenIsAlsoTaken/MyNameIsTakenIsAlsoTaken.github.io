Don't you sometimes get nostalgic about being sick as a kid and not going to school and being mostly home alone and watching movies on TV? I do too. Few days ago I came down with fever and took this chance to go back home and watch loads of movies. I chose most of them from the late 90's and early 00's to evoke that general sense of nostalgia.

It must be noted that I am not a movie watching kind of person. I feel very uncomfortable watching anything sad, painful, embarrassing, cringe-worthy, or disgusting. For that reason, it has been at least a year since I last watched a new movie.

I thought I'd post this list because I went to great lengths to make sure that the movie won't end up making me sad.
