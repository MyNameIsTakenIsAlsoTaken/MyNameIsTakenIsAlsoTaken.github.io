As I wrote in my (excruciatingly long and boring) article on [the Nepali language and Unicode](https://nirav.com.np/2019/10/16/on-the-nepali-language-and-unicode-1.html "On the Nepali language and Unicode"), typing in Nepali doesn't have to be a pain. You are absolutely free to make your own keyboard layout to type in Nepali Unicode (which, by the way, has much better fonts than Preeti and Sagarmatha). In fact, a few months ago, I made my own keyboard layout because there's no way I'm going to be able to cram the random key mappings of the traditional Nepali typing layout. Sorry dad, your son has renounced ancestral typing for good.

The layout I made is heavily based on the [LTK](http://ltk.org.np/ "Language Technology Kendra")'s phonetic keyboard layout (which is quite good on it's own). I made my layout to help me write code in the [मनसा programming language](http://mnsa.cc "manasa programming"). If you'd like to try out the language or the keyboard layout in your browser, head over to [mnsa.cc](http://mnsa.cc).
