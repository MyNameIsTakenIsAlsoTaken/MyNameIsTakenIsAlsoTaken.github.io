I randomly came across Marijn Haverbeke's [website](https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/ "Marijn's Website"). He has done a lot of extremely important and interesting stuff (codemirror, Eloquent Javascript, Tern), but his submission to [js1k](https://js1k.com "js1k code golfing") was particularly impressive. As always, when I come across really interesting on the internet, I hit `Ctrl+S` to save it for offline browsing. This strategy used to work nicely up till a few years ago because, thanks to the long power-cuts and on-and-off internet connectivity, you had no choice but to 'surf' your local hard drive most of the time. But these days I rarely, if ever, care to venture into the abandoned folders and files of the offline-land. So, in an effort to not forget, I am compiling lists of cool internet stuff right here on this blog.

I need to set a few ground rules so as not to go overboard with this. It is important that I:

1. add things to this list as I find them on the internet and write a short description.
2. use minimal effort per entry.
3. refrain from listing extremely specialized information.
