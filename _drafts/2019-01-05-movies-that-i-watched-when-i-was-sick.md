Don't you sometimes get nostalgic about being sick as a child and not going to school and being mostly home alone  watching movies on TV? I do too. Few days ago I came down with fever and took this chance to go back home and watch loads of movies. I chose most of them from the late 90's and early 00's to evoke that general sense of nostalgia.

I should mention beforehand that I'm not the movie watching kind of person. I feel uncomfortable watching any scene that's sad, painful, embarrassing, cringe-worthy, or disgusting. For that reason, it has been at least a year since I last watched a new movie.

I watch movies to escape, not for art or plot or story, so I have no problems fast-forwarding through anything that gets in the way of my way. You will find that most of the movies below fall in the comedy or romcom genre. That's premeditated.

I thought I'd post my list because I went to great lengths to make sure that the movies had happy endings and non-melancholic tones before I watched them. These movies, you'll find, are generally bright and comic.

# Harold and Kumar

![](https://nirav.com.np/assets/img/haroldkumar.jpg "Harold and Kumar snapshot")I loved _Harold and Kumar_. It is about two friends' adventure to a restaurant while high. Along the way they perform a surgery, smoke weed with and then ride on a cheetah, get their car stolen by Neil Patrick Harris and use a glider to escape a cop. This kind of outlandish plot and the comedy makes _Harold and Kumar_ greatly enjoyable; and while there are **several** movies of this type that overdo these ideas and end up being just ugly, _Harold and Kumar_ manages to make everything work together. I specially loved the character of Kumar as a brilliant slacker, and I think Kal Penn played him charmingly. There were a few scenes that I thought were way too disgusting to be funny, though, and I fast forwarded through them.

# Pride and Prejudice

![](https://nirav.com.np/assets/img/prideprejudice.jpg)I finished reading _Pride and Prejudice_ when sick and I really enjoyed it. It is set in the Regency era in Britain of which I know next to nothing so I decided to also watch the movie. The movie, as it turns out, is not set in the regency era but it is a good movie nonetheless.

Having read the book, I ended up skipping a lot. Mrs. Bennett makes it specially hard to watch. I couldn't stand to watch her make a fool of herself so I ended up just skipping any scene she is in. I also skipped most of the ballroom scenes and any part involving Mr. Collins or Lady Catherine. I liked the book better.

But in a lot of places the movie adds to the book. I loved the images of English countryside: the farms and animals, the streams and rivulets, the incredibly photogenic trees, the meadows and so on. In the end, watching the movie supplied me with many images and settings that I want to place the characters of the book against by reading it again. Also, watching this movie makes me want to reread _I Capture The Castle_, which is also set in the English countryside.

# 500 Days Of Summer

![](https://nirav.com.np/assets/img/500-summer.jpg)This movie is one of those instant favorites. All characters are very endearing and the setting is interesting. I loved the non-linear narrative and the use of _(500)_ as a counter. _500 Days Of Summer_ is funny, romantic and I'm definitely going to watch it many times again.

# When Harry Met Sally

Watching movies set in New York in the late 90's makes me very nostalgic, no idea why. And this movie is the epitome of New York in the 90's. I loved it. At times it gets cheesy but give me cheesy over sad any day. Also, Meg Ryan is beautiful.

# Pretty Woman

![](https://nirav.com.np/assets/img/pretty-woman.jpeg)If you are okay with fast forwarding through some sappy dialogue then this is a good movie. Your average millionaire falls in love with a hooker movie. _Pretty Woman_ is warm and funny, and I enjoyed it when I watched it. But ... I don't know. At some level, its just a rich guy throwing expensive gifts till a girl he has bought for the week falls in love. This must have been new in the 90's but in 2019 I can't help comparing _Pretty Woman_ with the movies that it probably inspired.

# Mr. & Mrs. Smith

I had fun watching this one. _Mr. & Mrs. Smith_ is great setting that lends itself to several of funny moments and witty dialogues.
