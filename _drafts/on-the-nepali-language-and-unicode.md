"Whoever controls the media controls the mind."

You know, I'm one of those people who ask, "but how much is a छप्पन्न?". If you are giving me your number, you can count on me saying, "Okay, repeat that. But in English."

And that makes sense, in a way. I have been an "internet-dweller" for as long as I can remember. Sure, I have come a long way from the childish "how to be ninja hattori?" days and the teenage "how to impress a girl you like?" days, but Google has been a constant throughout.
