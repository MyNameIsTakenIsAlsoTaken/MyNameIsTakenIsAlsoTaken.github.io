I happened upon a video talking about the iPod shuffles today. They were designed beautifully, so I went to the [ifixit](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPod+shuffle+3rd+Generation+Teardown/673) website and looked at the teardowns. It was inspiring. I already like designing small gadgets and products that I might never build. Starting with the rough sketches, then thinking about the electronics, the user experience and all other constraints is a great mental exercise (not to mention the best way to sit through boring lectures).

In this post, I am going to write down what I would do if I had the time and the resources to make one of my dream products. Keep in mind that these are just sad fantasies of a clumsy boy, and might never see the light of day.

I would start out by sketching many ideas for the device and think about how the user might interface with it. Since I'm not concerned about appealing to a wide audience, I can pick strange and arcane ways of interfacing with the device, like Morse code or gestures on capacitive-touch sensor array. I had researched extensively on fabricating capacitive-touch sensors last semester, and it seemed doable even with the little resources that I have.

After simplifying and refining the initial ideas, I would design a 3D model in Blender or Fusion360, and print it out on a 3D printer to get a general feel of the device. That 3D printout would also help me think about the volumetric arrangements of electronic components inside the device body.
