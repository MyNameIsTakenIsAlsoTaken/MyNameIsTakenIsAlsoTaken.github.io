This might not be the most ideal solution but I found at least 4 through hole schottky diodes inside an old router. I am also thinking of actually building a charge pump for a low current 12 volt source (to program them old at89c2051s), so those diodes might come in handy. On the other hand, the router is still works and I sometimes use it to network between 2 computers to move large files and so on. So if I can still buy schottkys, I will definitely want to do that.

I would post a picture of the teardown and things I found interesting but I dropped my phone on concrete. I might do it some other time with a list of all the things that can be salvaged from an old router for greedy people.
