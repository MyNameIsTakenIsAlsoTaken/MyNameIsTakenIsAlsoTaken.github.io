I was asked to animate a dot-matrix display for the robotics club recently. They wanted something that said "Robotics Club" to hang over their door. We had some old P10 (1r) DMDs which I had worked on in the past. Plus, even though I suck at it, I really love making animations. So I decided to give it a shot. This is the final result:

I'm sorry for the bad video, but that's all I have right now.
