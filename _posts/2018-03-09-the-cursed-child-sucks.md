It is 2 am in the morning. I have EDC accessments tomorrow(today). I spent the last several hours reading Harry Potter The cursed child.
And I am writing this because I have to say it to someone. And since my roommate, who is listening to a weird song and studying as I type, is not a very good candidate, I have to post this.
**The thing sucks.**
I very much spent the last few hours I had got to prepare for the accessment reading the cursed child. I mean, they called it the eighth story to the series. J. K. Rowling's name right at the front page. What was I to do? How was I to know that between the beautiful cover was just another bad fan fiction.
Rant begin:
For one, it started weird. The whole father-son conflict felt forced and unnatural. One can almost imagine the writer thinking *hmm... how to I get Albus to Delphi ... yes that! I'm sure the readers will believe this shit*
The characters were so off center. Just look at Ron making stupid jokes that felt forced. And look at Harry behaving with McGonagall the way movie Dumbledore behaved with Harry. Calmly. And the portrait Dumbledore. Incredibly useless and off character. I mean, did they think *yes, anything Harry Potter has to have a Dumbledore, even if it is pointless and stupid*?. Also, snape in the alternate reality was cheesy and out of character. The whole idea that Hermione became minister of magic because she and Ron paired up is enraging. I mean, this is Hermione. Hermione. Think about that.
Come on trolley Witch, you can't use blasting food and spikes in hand to stop children who are already running away.
What the hell Hermione? What happened to that purse of yours? Why the fuck would you keep the time turner inside an attacking bookshelf with riddles that can be solved by a 13 year old? WHY NOT A SIMPLE PASSWORD?
And I point blank refuse to beleive that time can be tampered with so easily. Why was a flying witch not noticed by the audience or the patrolling teachers? How could they disarm Cedric NEAR THE FUCKING DRAGON with no one noticing?
And the kids. The stupid kids. Man ... it fells like all my good memories of Harry Potter are trashed.
