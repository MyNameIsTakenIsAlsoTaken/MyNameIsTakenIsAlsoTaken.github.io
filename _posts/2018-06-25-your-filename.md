Yes. Mango is a dumbwatch. It uses 2 leds to display time (in a cryptic binary format that takes several seconds to comprehend). It is not pretty. It probably isn't waterproof (I'm obviously not gonna try dousing it) ... so on and so forth.

This is the thing I am working on right now. A few cool things about mango:

        This is the first circuit board I have printed in my life. I did everything: cutting, filing, toner transfer and etching to create a nice circular board that fits in the watch.

    It will probably run for months on a tiny lithium battery.

    It takes input in a morse coded binary string with just one pushbutton

I have uploaded a pic of what I have so far below:
        PIC

A little technical descripzion:
        It has an ATtiny13 as the main MCU which takes time from a DS1302 RTC. It runs on a CR2032.
