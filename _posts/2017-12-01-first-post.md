I'd like to start by saying: **Hello World!**

This is the first post on this site, and I am quite excited about it. After several days of frustrating errors, having to learn new things, and painful troubleshooting, I have finally achieved my ideal setup for passive blogging.

I basically set up github pages and jekyll with prose.io to allow me to write posts without having to push everytime. Now I just need to type posts in the beautiful prose interface and save them.
