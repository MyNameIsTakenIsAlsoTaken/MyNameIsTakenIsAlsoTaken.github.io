I've been working on and off on a programming language in Nepali language for quite some time. It isn't finished yet, 

1. VSCODE with c++ extentino is incredible. They seem to be making proper ASTs for my syntax on the fly. So far, I've only ever used vim and sublime without much configuration (for c and c++, that is). It makes things so much easier.
2. c++17 is great. I'm ysing things in ways they perhaps weren't meant to be used for better code management. One of them is I'm using lambdas for organisation of function code. it is fun.
3. pratt and recursive descent
4. I'm also working on a website **LINK SCREENSHOT**
