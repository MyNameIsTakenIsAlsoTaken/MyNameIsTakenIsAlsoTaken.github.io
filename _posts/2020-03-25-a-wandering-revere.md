<!--more-->

On rainy days I'm listless  
and wrapped in a blanket I stare  
out into the eyes of the vacant sky  
the puddles ripple and the wind  
she dances by,  
brushing my lips with a sublte kiss,   
a secret mischief, a certain aftertaste

On rainy days I'm meaningless,   
I sip my tea, and count the days  
I contemplate the rainy haze  
and when there is a sudden chill,  
a wandering reverie knocks my door  
she knocks thrice-oh, she knocks once more

Her name is you, her face is you  
she twirls for me: her dress is you  
She laughs with me  
so I presume  
her tender neck, it's your perfume

It's just a thought - a hollow dream  
but I think of you to some extreme  
Before the clouds are satisfied,   
then  
they step aside for a new sky

And promises of novel dreams  
New hands to hold, new lips to kiss
