I animated this a while back. I remember it took me days. First I had to learn how to actually draw the human skeleton (_The Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist_ by Stephen Peck is an amazing resource). Then I had to distill the ideas into the bare minimum required to get the picture across. Finally I drew and animated the whole thing in [piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com). The animation process was quite tedious, at least in part because this was my first try.
