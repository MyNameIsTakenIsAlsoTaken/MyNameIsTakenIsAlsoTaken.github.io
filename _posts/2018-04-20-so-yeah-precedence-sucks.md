Did you know that the equality (==) operator takes precedence over bitwise operators(&, |) in c? You probably did, because you must have memorized the precedence table in the first semester. Being a lazy ass, however, I didn't. Now, at that time, I didn't think much of it because I could use parenthesis whenever I was confused. Right? Well, maybe.

Let me tell you a sad story. Few days ago, I decided that I should start practically learning electronics. This was partly because I am going to fail EDC this semester (having written 3 Harry Potter fanfictions to pass time in the exam hall). I bought random capacitors, transistors, diodes and the like. I also already had an ATtiny13 and an Arduino. So yes, I download the AVR toolchain and trusty avrdude, and decide to the avr dialect of C. It was lovely. The datasheet detailed every little register, all the bits that could be flipped to output highs and lows. This was all beautiful because this would allow me to use my programming knowledge to make real physical things happen IRL. So yeah, I fantasized, I dreamed, I made little sketches of designs of things I would eventually make. Hell, I even read up on product designing.

Turns out, reality is harsh. Cold and unforgiving. I paid back for the slacking off in first sem. Fuck this world that runs on debts and karma.
