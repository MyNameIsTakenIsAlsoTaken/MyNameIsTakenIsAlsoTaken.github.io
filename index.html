			<p>I think it's pretty cool that you can get a .com.np domain name for free if you are from Nepal. So today, I randomly decided that I wanted one for myself. I rushed to the registration site and to my pleasant surprise, my name was not taken yet. Cool.</p>
			<p>So I registered it and that's why this site is here. I'm not sure what I plan to do with it, but as a computer engineering student, it is bound to come handy someday. I do have vague plans for the indefinite future so lets see what happens.</p>
