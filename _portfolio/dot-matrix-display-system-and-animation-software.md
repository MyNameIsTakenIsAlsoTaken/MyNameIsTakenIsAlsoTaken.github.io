I built the electronics, the driver software, and the animation software for an arrangement of Dot-Matrix Displays. The result is below:

The source code the animator and the AVR driver is on [GitHub](https://github.com/niravcodes/Animator-inator). I talk about how I build these things in [this](https://nirav.com.np/2019/06/12/animating-led-dot-matrix-displays-with-avr.html) blog post.
