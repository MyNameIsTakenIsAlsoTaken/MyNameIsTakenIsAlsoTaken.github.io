But, I really got to learn a lot of things from this project. For one, you know how you have to learn stuff like templates, private and public fields, inheritance and stuff that you're sure you'll never use in real life? I had so many cases where was having a problem, but then after thinking long and hard about it, I'd realize that using this or that language feature would solve it in one stroke. 

It was as though epiphanies were raining down my ceiling, naked, and yelling 'eureka' (no kidding).
