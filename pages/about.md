Hey. I am Nirav, a computer engineering student from Nepal. You're on my personal website where I generally write about what I'm up to. My intention is to publicly document my projects and experiments.

My hobbies include reading fiction (Murakami, García Márquez and Ginsberg are some writers I revere), coding, drawing, designing, and playing my guitar in free time. That said, I consider my skills at best tolerable in all fields.
