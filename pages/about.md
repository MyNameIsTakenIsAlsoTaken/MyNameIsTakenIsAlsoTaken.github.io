Hey. I am Nirav Nikhil. I am a computer engineering student from Nepal. You're on my personal website where I generally write about what I'm up to. 

My hobbies include reading (Murakami is one of my favorites), coding, drawing, designing, and playing my guitar in free time. You can read about my endeavors here on this blog.
