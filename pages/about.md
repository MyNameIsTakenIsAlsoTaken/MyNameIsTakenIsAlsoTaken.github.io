Hi! I'm Nirav. I'm a computer engineering student from Nepal. I am interested in computers, electronics, programming, art, music and everything in between. This blog is a public documentation of the many things I learn when I indulge in my endeavors and tinkerings.

My hobbies include writing software, reading fiction (Murakami, García Márquez and Ginsberg are ones I'm particularly fond of), and playing sad tunes on my guitar. Check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/niravcodes "github niravcodes").

> I want to make beautiful things, even if nobody cares.
