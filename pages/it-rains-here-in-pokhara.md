If you think being madly in love with your bestfriend's girlfriend is bad, try sitting next to him during a Microprocessor lecture having to listen to him describe the sex they had the day before. What's more, Microprocessor is one of the few subjects I enjoy. My friend is normally a level-headed person who doesn't speak much, but it seems that the excitement of the first time is grand enough for him to break his character. Needless to say, I'm miserable.

I look out the window, if only to somehow communicate to him my lack of enthusiasm. It doesn't work. The class goes on for another forty minutes in which he fills me in on the color of the curtains, flavor of the condom, state of the bed sheets after they were done and what not. I surely don't want to advertise my bestfriend as an idiot here, but he's acting like one today. I try very hard to pretend to be listening while also mentally singing _lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala_. 

The day is overcast and a thin fog has sucked the life off colors. Leafless trees stand tall, looking like giant skeletons with arms raised towards the sky. In a distance, I see the new ICTC building as it's being constructed. From afar, it looks like tiny ant-men are scurrying about, assembling the universe one breadcrumb at a time.

When the class is finally over, I can't wait to get away. We head out together with a group of friends. The next class is pronounced intolerable by the crowd without first having a cup of tea. By this design, the group starts towards the canteen. Naturally, I'd rather avoid having to hear any more about the girl I love violated in various positions. So I invent some excuse or another, I don't remember now, and take off.

I amble around the campus, careful to avoid any place I might run into a friend. My intent is to avoid my group for some time, letting the novelty of the whole situation wear off. The cool breeze is rich with the smell of rain. It somehow blows against you no matter which direction you face.

I'm near the Civil block when, out of nowhere, without preparation, a girl misses a step and falls nose-first to the (thankfully soft) ground. Her friends are by her side. They pick her up, dust her off and seeing that she is somewhat disoriented, take her to the nearest sitting place. They do this with such fluid motion that the whole event emanates the quality of an oft-repeated ritual. It gives you the impression that the curly haired girl is always falling, her friends always dusting her off and guiding her to the nearest sitting place. I don't know, maybe it's true. So I decide to defer all judgements excepting one; that she has good friends. 

The next class starts in a few minutes but I have no intention of attending it. I board a bus to Mahendra Pul. There is no particular reason to be there, and I'm always short on money at this point of the month, but I need to do something to take my mind off things.

The curly haired girl amuses my thoughts for a while, but on the bus, looking out the window, my thoughts circle back to Shraddha. (That's her name, by the way.) In my solitude, I'm free to think of her as I choose (her bright eyes, the way she walks strangely reminiscent of a duck, the fact that she has a pixie cut with bangs that reach down her eyes, or that she can quote so many writers without even being aware of it ... I could go on). But of course my mind wanders back to the same dingy motel room.

Mahendrapul is busy as always. The usual scattering of fruit vendors have placed themselves at every turning, sitting amidst baskets of strawberries, apples and tangerines, colors of which have dulled due to a thin layer of dust that was raised by the roaring green buses steered by solemn drivers looking to take a smoke break in Bagar. Smells pouring from the Marwadi mingles with the various trails of perfume which might will lead to a group of girls huddled around a small table waiting for their order at Samrat's or to a fashionable group of women purchasing shoes in the Big Baazar. I lose myself in the crowd and it is soothing. The coffee shop I'm languidly strolling to is now visible; there I place my order. A light drizzle has started to fall outside the shop.

I used to love the rain. My old journals are full of cheesy poems I had written inspired by the petrichor. That is, of course, till I came to Pokhara. It rains so much here, and with such vengeance that the whole romance of the rainfall becomes an everyday nuisance.

The barista is a pleasant man a few years older than me. He has a smile ready for every occasion and uses it to great effect. He brings a cup of warm water as soon as I'm seated. A little later he brings me the coffee, his happy smile firmly in place. 

Sipping my coffee, I contemplate the melancholy atmosphere here in this cafe. The aroma of freshly ground coffee interweaves itself with the charming melody playing through the speakers; thin drops of water hit the window pane and leisurely converge; the coffee machine whirs intermittently; and the everyday chatter and bustle of other people add to the ambiance. These last few days have had a peculiar quality to them. A quality that invokes poignant reflections and makes you want to smoke cigarette after cigarette in some dirty roadside restaurant. 

I say peculiar because I have never smoked before.

At some point the barista sets down a plate with a cinnamon roll on it. I'm knocked out of my reverie. I question him with a look, and he explains, "on the house". He gives a wide toothy grin and I know that he won't go away until I smile back. I've found this quality charismatic at times, though right now I'm annoyed. Nonetheless I muster a small reply. He goes away satisfied.
