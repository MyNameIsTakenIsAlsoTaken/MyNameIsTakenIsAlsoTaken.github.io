As the editor, I have to read your submissions and straighten out awkward sentences, try to make long sentences more readable, correct grammatical and formatting and word usage errors and so on. In doing so, it is possible that I misunderstand your creative intentions and make unwarranted changes. To make sure your article is the way you want it, I am have uploaded the editing copies of your text. Since you're the writer, you have the final say in what finally gets published. So make sure you tell me about the edits and changes that you don't agree with.

Below I provide links the documents which contain your article with my edits and comments in them. The comments talk about why I felt the need to make the change, and ask you to clarify certain sentences. 

These documents can be opened in Microsoft Word and reviewed. To see the changes, go to the 'Review' tab and select 'All Markup' from the dropdown as indicated in the picture below.

If you don't want to see the changes made, click on the 'All Markup' and change that to 'Simple Markup' which retains comments.

The links to the articles are below.
