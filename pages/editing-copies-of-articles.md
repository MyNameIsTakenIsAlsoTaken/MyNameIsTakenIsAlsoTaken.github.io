As the editor, I have to read your submissions and straighten out awkward sentences, try to make long sentences more readable, correct grammatical and formatting and word usage errors and so on. In doing so, it is possible that I misunderstand your creative intentions and make unwarranted changes. To make sure your article is the way you want it, I am have uploaded the editing copies of your text. Since you're the writer, you have the final say in what finally gets published. So make sure you tell me about the edits and changes that you don't agree with. 

Below I provide links the documents which contain your article with my edits and comments in them. These documents can be opened in Microsoft Word and reviewed.![](https://nirav.com.np/assets/img/scr1.png)
