The Nepali language gets very little representation on the internet. Take, for example, the Nepali Wikipedia which has about 33 thousand articles. The Esperanto Wikipedia boasts 8 times that number (at around two hundred thousand articles). Which is kind of sad, because Esperanto is an artificial language created by **one** person in the 19th century. It is spoken by a meager 2 million people worldwide. Compare this to the Nepali language, which has more than 25 million speakers.

You know how they say, “whoever controls the media controls the mind”. And the media of the 21st century, the internet, is so desperately out of the Nepali’s hands that, not only do we read the news, articles, the weather, and novels in English, but we go on to caption our photos, of warm, intimate moments in English. My little brother will sniff my phone from a mile away and hide out in some corner to watch Motu Patlu, the Hindi cartoon, on YouTube. He might not be as fluent in Hindi as he is in Nepali. No, that might never happen. But in his little world, Hindi is the language that superheroes speak. And Nepali? His annoying brother.

Now don’t get me wrong here. I am not saying that at some point Nepali will just disappear into oblivion. What I’m saying is that, without even knowing it, we’ll wake up one day to find our own language so detached, so out of sync from the everyday reality which we live in, that it will just stop meaning anything important. And that, when we finally realize it, we will not feel दुःखि or even चिन्तित. We’ll feel ‘depressed’. So no, I’m not saying that it will be forgotten. 

(1) Much worse. It will fall into the little space between the bed and the wall, and we’ll just leave it there. Neglected, like a little pencil.

(2) Much worse. It will be neglected, much like one of those pencils which fall into the space between the bed and the wall and which we just leave there.

It’s as T.S. Eliot once wrote,

“This is the way the world ends

Not with a bang but a whimper.”
